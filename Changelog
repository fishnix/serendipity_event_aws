 * Upgraded to sdk v2.6.15

20121220 ECF
 * Upgraded to sdk v1.5.17.1
 * Corrected for _construct changes in SDK
 * Default to "Cache Only" mode to false
 * Added S3 Storage type options
 * Only build caching mechs when cache is enabled

20110615 ECF
 * Simplified messages + methods
 * Upload method should be able to upload multiple objects, now it can

20110613 ECF
 * Started cache update on media upload

20110525 ECF
 * Broke out s3 upload into function
 * made regex search for objects in entries a little better
 * Added object list storage mech selection
 * Added rudimentary file based object list store

20110523 ECF
 * Started rolling DB support for object list
 * Purge/Build list of objects in s3 on plugin config save (instead of on each entry munge!)

20110515 ECF
 * separate what happens in cache-only mode versus full mode
 * handle backend_preview

20110514 ECF
 * pull list of objects from AWS + return array
   * This will need to be stored somewhere and probably asynchronous to perform
 * Started search + replace work for cache-only mode
   * Currently builds a pattern + replacement array and replaces corresponding pattern in text
 * I think we can add efficiency by doing:
   - an asynchronous load of the pattern/replace into memcache (or DB)
   - config option to say how often to refresh memcache pattern/replace
   - each request check a variable for the last time memcache was reloaded
     - if < refreshInterval ago, use the one we have
     - if > refreshInterval ago, refresh then resume processing

20110323 ECF
 * Introduced on "Cache only" mode to avoid having to get sync code working immediately, probably
   more compelling to most people anyways.
 * Started code to pull list from s3
 * Made the replacement code  more robust (doing more than replacing anything in the upload dir)
 * Little bit of optimization -- moved "if"s out to avoid unnecessary code execution
 * Comments!
